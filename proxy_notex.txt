same interface different behavior
ex - communication proxy

proxy vs decorator 

fundamental difference is that a proxy contains the proxy interface (identical to original interface) and original interface as one layer 
necessarily it is used to add some extra logic, but to existing interface methods,

decorator is used to decorate the class applied to and requires reference to it , the result is a decorator class that has extra functionality and it is 
meant to be a different interface than theo original class it is applied on
